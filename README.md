# Food Hopespots
==============================

Takes the FoE Hopespots project (https://medium.com/@geofutures/finding-hope-in-the-green-belt-8b7131450849) and modifies it to identify potential food production locations in the urban and peri-urban areas of Lancaster.

The project has been further supported by the Lancaster University Rurban project and by Mark Thurstain-Goodwin.

## An initial guide for the non-expert

As a digital mapping project, which requires some spatial analysis and modelling, the non-expert may feel somewhat daunted by the process involved. The document 1.0_mtg_basic_introduction_to_defining_food_hopespots-checkpoint which can be found in the /notebooks directory offers a step by step guide for the non-expert, using data from the Rurban project in Lancaster.

## Expected developments

We plan to also publish a more formal coded model using the Aye-Aye ETL framework in due course.
